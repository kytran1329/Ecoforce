            <h2>Why Reduce Plastic Usage?</h2>
            <p>Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, and during that time, it breaks down into microplastics that can enter the food chain, affecting both wildlife and human health.</p>
            <p>By reducing our plastic usage, we can help mitigate these impacts, protect our environment, and move towards a more sustainable future. Every small change in our daily habits can make a significant difference.</p>
